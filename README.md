# Instacart Basket Analysis (Python Project)

This repository contains my Python project from the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program (Achievement 4).  
It demonstrates the complete process of importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data using Python.

## Project Overview

Instacart is an online grocery store that wants to learn more about its customers’ purchasing behavior.  
This analysis examines customer orders to identify patterns and trends that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

## Objectives

1. Analyze key customer segments based on their purchasing habits.  
2. Identify relationships between order frequency, spending, and customer demographics.  
3. Provide recommendations for marketing and operational improvements.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3  
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Folder Structure

- **Scripts**: All Jupyter notebooks from Tasks 4.2 through 4.10. These cover data import, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Analysis**: Contains visualizations, reports, and test outputs generated during analysis.  
- **Project Management**: Contains documentation and planning materials.  
- **Sent to Client**: Final report delivered to stakeholders.

## Key Insights

- Customers with families tend to place larger, more frequent orders.  
- The loyalty segment represents the highest-value customers and contributes a significant share of revenue.  
- Orders peak on weekends and in early morning hours.

## Next Steps

- Automate weekly reporting of customer trends.  
- Develop segmentation models to improve marketing targeting.  
- Create dashboards for ongoing performance monitoring.
